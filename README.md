Research contribution assignment: Analysis of Hodotermopsis tandem running

Objective
The task is to analyze movement data from Hodotermopsis mating pairs to quantify their tandem running behavior and how dish size affects their coordination. Your analysis will directly contribute to a manuscript in preparation, and significant contributions lead to co-authorship.

General guidelines
Use Python and/or R for analysis
Save all codes so that others can reproduce the results
Create visualized plots for each of the result
Prepare a short document (1-2 paragraphs) summarizing the findings and methods
You can use ChatGPT to speed up your workflow, but you should fully understand the output and become confident that you could achieve the same solution independently if given more time.
Seek help from either Elijah or me when you needed.
Refer to my previous work for ideas on analysis and visualization: https://mizumoto-lab.com/publication/â€”but feel free to be creative!
Count time spent on this assignment as working hours.
Once your analysis is completed, I will compile the outputs to finalize the manuscript draft.
Tasks
There are two major tasks. I will give examples to achieve these. You can follow these and/or do something else as long as tasks are achieved. Additional analyses are also welcome.

1. Quantifying tandem running behavior

Calculate how often each pair exhibits tandem running within the recorded period.

Compare the duration of male-led vs. female-led tandem runs.

Investigate how frequently pairs switch leading roles during tandem running.

Visualize movement trajectories of pairs to illustrate coordination.


3. Investigating the effect of dish size (90 or 140) on tandem running

Compare tandem run duration between different dish sizes.

Compare tandem run speed between different dish sizes

Output
Codes
Visualized plots for each of the results are in PDF format
Prepare a short document (1-2 paragraphs) summarizing the findings and methods

What I am Doing:
1. Quantifying tandem running behavior
   a. Make a probability graph for durations of male led vs female led tandem runs (survivorship curve, make it by size and sex) (survcurv for sep by prev leader and sizes)
   b. Investigate how frequently pairs switch leading roles during tandem running. (compared based on Sex of the initial leader + Average speed + A time series plot showing when switches happen (frames vs switch events) or just like a chart with average switches)
2. Investigating the effect of dish size (90 or 140) on tandem running
   a. Compare tandem run duration between different dish sizes. (Surviviorship curve)
   b. Compare tandem run speed between different dish sizes
